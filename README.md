# Breed Classifier: Dog and Cat

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation designed to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. Using deep learning techniques, the model is trained on labeled image datasets and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between these two breeds.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Normalizes and resizes images for consistent model input.
- **CNN Architecture**: Multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
- **Binary Classification**: Outputs a prediction score for either 'Dog' or 'Cat'.
- **Visualization**: Displays training progress and prediction results.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```

---

## Dataset

The model uses a labeled dataset of dog and cat images. Popular datasets include:
- [Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)

Ensure that the dataset is structured as follows:
```
/dataset
    /train
        /dogs
        /cats
    /validation
        /dogs
        /cats
```

---

## Model Architecture

The CNN is designed as follows:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size 150x150x3.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps.
- **Dense Layers**: Classify the extracted features.
- **Output Layer**: Sigmoid activation for binary classification.

---

## Training Process

1. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 150x150 and normalized.
2. **Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied.
3. **Training**: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
4. **Validation**: Model performance is validated using unseen data.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breed-classifier.git
cd breed-classifier
```

### Train the Model
Ensure the dataset is in place and run:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Test the Model
Use the trained model to classify new images:
```bash
python predict.py --image-path /path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results

- **Accuracy**: Achieved up to 95% accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Loss**: Minimal loss observed during validation.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized to show classification performance.
